review: You're done

Take a look at the coverage. Remove driver from coverage.

A few minor refactoring suggestions.

Fix those and you're done.

review: nice progress

Almost there. Write a driver program (with main) that reads a file of ISBN
numbers, prints the desired result. In the file include some valid isbn and 
a few invalid isbn numbers.

review: Return result or error, don't log.

Fix coverage report or ask for help.
The problem does not ask for logging, don't log.
See suggestion in code.

review: design for clarity

Design so the receiver clearly knows when they receive a valid data and when
they receive an error detail.

review: Let's address some design issues

Let's address a design concern. We want the method to give us error detail instead
of throwing. This will help simplify the higher level method.

review: let's rethink the steps.

Remove code not covered by tests (red in code coverage report).

Let's rethink the next steps.

review: Revisit the design

Fix red in code coverage report.
The test is doing logic, remove that and rework on the data structure to
support duplication of titles.

review: good direction

Include coverage report (see assign1 build file).

Good direction.

Nice tests, it gives insight into the data structure. Let's take a look
at what it tells us.

review: focus on behavior than state

Don't focus on state (don't start with get or set). Instead think of core
behavior first, what would we do if data was already available.

review: Create a build file

Need a build file to compile and run tests.

Focus on core behavior, bring in dependencies much later.
