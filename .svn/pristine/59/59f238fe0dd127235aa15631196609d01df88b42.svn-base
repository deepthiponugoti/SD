1. see suggestions.

2. 
Good pattern. Related to that, there is also another pattern exactly at the
same place. What about other patterns elsewhere in the code/design.

3. Any other principle used here?

4. 
(c) This is just an enum, not a singleton.

1. Good, are there more. Visit code closely to see.

3. Give one space after period that ends each sentence.
Give one space after comma.
