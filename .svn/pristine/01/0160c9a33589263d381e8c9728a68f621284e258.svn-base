1. What did you essentially learn in this course about design?

Design plays a very important role in the software development.
Quality of the software varies highly due to the design.
Many aspects like time, cost are greatly influenced by the design.We also learnt that It is very difficult to design right at the first time. 
Design is not just only about the uml diagrams but there are several metrics to measure the quality of design like design principles and patterns that are very useful in software development.
One of the important thing we have learned in this course is TDD(Test Driven Development).
Everything we design or code must be test driven.We learnt the importance of TDD slowly as we went through different assignments.


2. When asked to design a software application, how would you approach it?

1)First, we will implement a strategic design so that we can get a basic idea about the features of the application.
2)Then we take a simple feature and try to write a code for it by following many principles like SRP, SLAP, YAGNI  etc.
3)We will make sure about having good variable names, avoiding long methods and also follow DRY principle.
4)For the code we wrote we will write test cases where ever it is necessary and check the coverage report so that everything is been tested.
5)Next by following OCP principle we will try to extend the code as much as possible and go to other steps in the same way.
6)During this process we will follow design patterns where ever it is necessary.

3. What are some of the general guidelines you would follow when designing?

Guidelines:

1)Low coupling and high Cohesion between methods.
2)Test Driven Development(Every part of the code should be tested).
3)Good Variable names and method names so that it is easy to understanding the code.
4)Follow the design principles and patterns wherever it is necessary.
