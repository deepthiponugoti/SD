review: simplify the interface

Reduce parameters. This will reduce burden on the user and also reduce
user errors.

review: consider not storing the form as a string

Heading in a good direction. However, consider not storing the form as a string 
(consider not storing it at all).

Simply tests, sign of design not being focused on the problem.

review: good start

TransformAvatarTest:

The first test method is so long I gave up about 25% into reading the name.
Make that concise and clear.

Ah, -1, that is not very intuitive. Let's change that to more explicitly convey the intent.

Also, would it be possible to design so that the last test would not be needed?

TransformAvatar:
Reduce code, a lot.
